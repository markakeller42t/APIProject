API Project

This is code generated from the VS 2017 New Project Template:
	-	ASP.NET Core 2.2
	-	Web Application
	-	Use Docker
	-	Use HTTPS
	-	Change Authentication to Individual User Accounts, Local Data Store
	
My intent is to: 
	1.	Implement a docker-compose container and include a SQL Server on Linux container with SQL Server Express
	2.	Implement a User Controller supporting User CRUD and Authentication JWT Tokens
	3.	Strip out the MVC front end so I can develop my own Angular front end
